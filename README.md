# Age and Gender Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This coursework implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting **age (regression)** and **gender (classification)** from structured input data. The project emphasises rigorous data preprocessing, model selection, and quantitative evaluation to assess predictive performance and generalisation.

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset containing relevant features, the task is to:
- Predict **gender** as a binary classification problem  
- Predict **age** as a continuous regression problem  

The aim is to design models that are both accurate and robust while following best practices in applied machine learning.

## Methodology
The project follows a systematic data science workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and handling of missing values  
   - Feature selection and transformation  
   - Train–validation split to prevent data leakage  

2. **Model Development**
   - Implementation of supervised learning models for classification and regression  
   - Hyperparameter configuration and training  

3. **Evaluation**
   - Gender prediction evaluated using classification metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision, recall)  
   - Age prediction evaluated using regression metrics (e.g. MAE, MSE)  
   - Analysis of model performance and limitations  

## Results & Analysis
The final models demonstrate that meaningful patterns can be learned from the dataset to predict both age and gender. Quantitative evaluation highlights the trade-offs between model complexity and performance, alongside areas for potential improvement such as feature engineering and tuning.

## Technologies Used
